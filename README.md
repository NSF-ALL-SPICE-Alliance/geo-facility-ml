Student stipends for this work were funded by the Pacific Intelligence Innovation Initiative ([P3I](https://hawaiip3i.org/))




## This repository contains files for an interactive map of mental health facilities and their services in the United States. Data was gathered from [SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/national-directory-of-mental-health-treatment-facilities).
### File Index
- filter_map_2 : most current RMD, contains code for map
- facilities_map / filter_map : preprocessing
- national_directory_MH.xlxs : service codes and translations
- geocoded_facilities : coordinates for mental facilities in US



  ## Next Steps
  - UI/aesthetic changes
  - live host
  - using ML, predict optimal location for new facility
