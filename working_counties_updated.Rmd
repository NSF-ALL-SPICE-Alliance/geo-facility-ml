Read in Data *SA not MH
```{r}

```

Merge Columns
```{r}
facilities <- facilities %>%
  unite(whole_adress, c("street1", "city", "state", "zip"), sep = " ")
```

Geocode facilities (Takes 2.5 hours to run)
```{r}
facilities <- facilities %>%
geocode(whole_adress, method = 'osm', lat = latitude , long = longitude)
```

Save geocoded facilities file
```{r}
write_csv(facilities, here("geocoded_facilities.csv"))
```

Read in geocoded facilities file
```{r}
geocoded_facilities <- read_csv(here("geocoded_facilities.csv"))
